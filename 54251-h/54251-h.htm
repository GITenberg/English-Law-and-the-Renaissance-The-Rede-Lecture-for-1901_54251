<h2>ENGLISH LAW
AND THE RENAISSANCE.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><i>Mr Vice-Chancellor and Fellow-Students</i>:</p>

<p>Were we to recall to life the good Sir
Robert Rede who endowed lecturers in this
university, we might reasonably hope that he
would approve and admire the fruit that in
these last years has been borne by his liberality.
And then, as in private duty or private interest
bound, I would have him speak thus: ‘Yes, it
is marvellous and more than marvellous this
triumph of the sciences that my modest rent-charge
stimulates you annually to record; nor do
I wonder less at what my lecturers have said of
humane letters and the fine arts, of the history
of all times and of my time, of Erasmus whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
I remember, and that age of the Renaissance
(as you call it) in which (so you say) I lived.
But there is one matter, one science (for such
we accounted it) of which they seem to have
said little or nothing; and it happens to be a
matter, a science, in which I used to take some
interest and which I endeavoured to teach. You
have not, I hope, forgotten that I was not only
an English judge, but, what is more, a reader
in English law<a href="#note1" id="anchor1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.’</p>

<p>Six years ago a great master of history,
whose untimely death we are deploring, worked
the establishment of the Rede lectures into
the picture that he drew for us of The Early
Renaissance in England<a href="#note2" id="anchor2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. He brought Rede’s
name into contact with the names of Fisher and
More. That, no doubt, is the right environment,
and this pious founder’s care for the humanities,
for logic and for philosophy natural and moral
was a memorable sign of the times. Nevertheless
the fact remains that, had it not been for
his last will and testament, we should hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
have known Sir Robert except as an English
lawyer who throve so well in his profession that
he became Chief Justice of the Common Bench.
And the rest of the acts of Robert Rede&mdash;we
might say&mdash;and the arguments that he urged
and the judgments that he pronounced, are they
not written in queer old French in the Year
Books of Henry VII and Henry VIII? Those
ancient law reports are not a place in which
we look for humanism or the spirit of the
Renaissance: rather we look there for an
amazingly continuous persistence and development
of medieval doctrine.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should hardly believe if we were
told for the first time that in the reign of
James I a man who was the contemporary of
Shakespeare and Bacon, a very able man too
and a learned, who left his mark deep in English
history, said, not by way of paradox but in sober
earnest, said repeatedly and advisedly, that a
certain thoroughly medieval book written in
decadent colonial French was ‘the most perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and absolute work that ever was written in
any human science<a href="#note3" id="anchor3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.’ Yet this was what Sir
Edward Coke said of a small treatise written
by Sir Thomas Littleton, who, though he did
not die until 1481, was assuredly no child of
the Renaissance.</p>

<p>I know that the names of Coke and Littleton
when in conjunction are fearsome names or tiresome,
and in common honesty I am bound to
say that if you stay here you will be wearied.
Still I feel that what is at fault is not my theme.
A lecturer worthy of that theme would&mdash;I am
sure of it&mdash;be able to convince you that there is
some human interest, and especially an interest
for English-speaking mankind, in a question
which Coke’s words suggest:&mdash;How was it and
why was it that in an age when old creeds of
many kinds were crumbling and all knowledge
was being transfigured, in an age which had
revolted against its predecessor and was fully
conscious of the revolt, one body of doctrine
and a body that concerns us all remained so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
intact that Coke could promulgate this prodigious
sentence and challenge the whole world
to contradict it<a href="#note4" id="anchor4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>? I have not the power to tell
and you to-day have not the time to hear that
story as it should be told. A brief outline of
what might be said is all that will be possible
and more than will be tolerable.</p>

<p>Robert Rede died in January, 1519. Let us
remember for a moment where we stand at that
date. The Emperor Maximilian also was dying.
Henry VIII was reigning in England, Francis I
in France, Charles I in Spain, Leo X at Rome.
But come we to jurisprudence. Is it beneath
the historic muse to notice that young Mr More,
the judge’s son, had lately lectured at Lincoln’s
Inn<a href="#note5" id="anchor5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>? Perhaps so. At all events for a while
we will speak of more resonant exploits. We
could hardly (so I learn at second-hand) fix a
better date than that of Rede’s death for the
second new birth of Roman law. More’s friend
Erasmus had turned his back on England and
was by this time in correspondence with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
accomplished jurists, the Italian Andrea Alciato
and the German Ulrich Zäsi. They and the
French scholar Guillaume Budé were publishing
books which mark the beginning of a new era<a href="#note6" id="anchor6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
Humanism was renovating Roman law. The
medieval commentators, the Balduses and Bartoluses,
the people whom Hutten and Rabelais<a href="#note7" id="anchor7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
could deride, were in like case with Peter
Lombard, Duns Scotus and other men of the
night. Back to the texts! was the cry, and let
the light of literature and history play upon
them<a href="#note8" id="anchor8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The great Frenchmen who were to do
the main part of the work and to make the
school of Bourges illustrious were still young or
unborn; Cujas was born in 1522; but already
the advanced guard was on the march and the
flourish of trumpets might be heard<a href="#note9" id="anchor9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. And
then in 1520&mdash;well, we know what happened
in 1520 at Wittenberg, but perhaps we do not
often remember that when the German friar
ceremoniously and contumeliously committed
to the flames some venerated law-books&mdash;this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
if an event in the history of religion, was also
an event in the history of jurisprudence. A
current of new life was thrilling through one
Corpus Juris<a href="#note10" id="anchor10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; the other had been sore stricken,
and, if it escaped from violent death, might
perish yet more miserably of a disease that
becomes dangerous at the moment when it is
discovered.</p>

<p>A few years afterwards an enlightened young
humanist, of high rank and marked ability, a
man who might live to be pope of Rome or
might live to be king of England, was saying
much evil of the sort of law that Rede had
administered and taught; was saying that a
wise prince would banish this barbaric stuff
and receive in its stead the civil law of the
Romans. Such, so we learn from one of his
friends, was the talk of Reginald Pole, and a
little knowledge of what was happening in
foreign countries is enough to teach us that
such talk deserves attention<a href="#note11" id="anchor11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>This was the time when Roman law was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
driving German law out of Germany or forcing
it to conceal itself in humble forms and obscure
corners<a href="#note12" id="anchor12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. If this was the age of the Renaissance
and the age of the Reformation, it was also the
age of the ‘Reception.’ I need not say that this
Reception&mdash;the reception of Roman law&mdash;plays
a large part in modern versions of German
history, and by no means only in such as are
written by lawyers. I need not say that it
has been judged from many different points of
view, that it has been connected by some with
political, by others with religious and by yet
others with economic changes. Nor need I say
that of late years few writers have had a hearty
good word for the Reception. We have all of
us been nationalists of late. Cosmopolitanism
can afford to await its turn<a href="#note13" id="anchor13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>Then we observe that not long after Pole
had been advocating a Reception, his cousin
King Henry, whose word was law supreme in
church and state, prohibited the academic study
of one great and ancient body of law&mdash;the canon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
law<a href="#note14" id="anchor14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;and encouraged the study of another&mdash;the
civil law&mdash;by the foundation of professorships
at Oxford and Cambridge. We observe
also that his choice of a man to fill the chair
at Cambridge fell on one who was eminently
qualified to represent in his own person that
triad of the three R’s&mdash;Renaissance, Reformation
and Reception. We know Professor Thomas
Smith as a humanist, an elegant scholar with
advanced opinions about the pronunciation of
Greek. We know the Reverend Thomas Smith
as a decided, if cautious, protestant whose doings
are of some interest to those who study the
changeful history of ecclesiastical affairs. Then
we know Dr Thomas Smith as a doctor in law
of the university of Padua, for with praiseworthy
zeal when he was appointed professor at
Cambridge he journeyed to the fountain-head
for his Roman law and his legal degree<a href="#note15" id="anchor15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. Also
he visited those French universities whence a
new jurisprudence was beginning to spread.
He returned to speak to us in two inaugural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
lectures of this new jurisprudence: to speak
with enthusiasm of Alciatus and Zasius<a href="#note16" id="anchor16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>: to
speak hopefully of the future that lay before
this conquering science&mdash;the future that lay
before it in an England fortunately ruled by a
pious, wise, learned and munificent Prince. Then
in Edward VI’s day Thomas Smith as a Master
of Requests was doing justice in a court whose
procedure was described as being ‘altogether
according to the process of summary causes in
the civil law’ and at that moment this Court of
Requests and other courts with a like procedure
seemed to have time, reason and popularity
upon their side<a href="#note17" id="anchor17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Altogether, the Rev. Prof.
Dr Sir Thomas Smith, Knt., M.P., Dean of
Carlisle, Provost of Eton, Ambassador to the
Court of France and Secretary of State to
Queen Elizabeth was a man of mark in an
age of great events. Had some of those events
been other than they were, we might now be
saying of him that he played a prominent part
in Renaissance, Reformation and Reception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and a part characteristic of that liberal and
rational university of which he was professor,
public orator and vice-chancellor<a href="#note18" id="anchor18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>Some German historians, as you are aware,
have tried to find or to fashion links that will
in some direct and obvious manner connect the
Reformation and the Reception. In one popular
version of the tale protestantism finds a congenial
ally in the individualism and capitalism of the
pagan Digest<a href="#note19" id="anchor19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. In truth I take it that the story
is complex. Many currents and cross-currents
were flowing in that turbid age. It so happens
that in this country we can connect with the
heresiarchal name of Wyclif a proposal for the
introduction of English law, as a substitute for
Roman law, into the schools of Oxford and
Cambridge<a href="#note20" id="anchor20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. On the other hand, the desire for
a practical Reception of the civil law is ascribed
to the future cardinal, who in his last days
reconciled England for a moment, not with the
Rome of the Digest, but with the Rome of the
Decretals. And by the way we may notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that when the cardinal was here upon his
reconciliatory errand he had for a while as his
legal adviser one of the most learned lawyers of
that age, the Spaniard Antonio Agustin. But
we in England take little notice of this famous
man, who, so foreigners assure us now-a-days,
began the historical study of the canon law and
knew more about the false Isidore than it was
comfortable for him to know<a href="#note21" id="anchor21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Our Dr Smith
was protestant enough; but his Oxford colleague
Dr John Story showed zeal in the
cremation of protestants, helped Alva (so it is
said) to establish the Inquisition in the Netherlands,
was hanged as a traitor at Tyburn in
1571 and beatified as a martyr at Rome in
1886. Blessed John Story was zealous; but
his permanent contribution to the jurisprudence
of his native land was (so far as I am aware)
an early precedent for the imprisonment of a
disorderly member by the House of Commons,
and a man may be disorderly without being a
jurist<a href="#note22" id="anchor22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Ulrich Zäsi went part of the way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Luther; but then stayed behind with Erasmus<a href="#note23" id="anchor23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
He had once compared the work that he was
doing for the Corpus Juris with the work that
Luther was doing for the Bible<a href="#note24" id="anchor24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. The great
Frenchmen answered the religious question in
different ways. One said ‘That has nothing to
do with the praetor’s edict.’ His rivals charged
him with a triple apostasy<a href="#note25" id="anchor25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. Three or four of
them were stout huguenots, and we must not
forget that Calvin and Beza had both been at
Bourges and had both studied the civil law.
Melanchthon also was a warm admirer of Roman
jurisprudence<a href="#note26" id="anchor26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. It is reported that Elizabeth
invited Francis Hotman to Oxford<a href="#note27" id="anchor27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. He was
protestant enough, and fierce enough to exchange
letters with a tiger<a href="#note28" id="anchor28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. He is best known
to English law-students as the man who spoke
light words of Littleton and thus attracted
Coke’s thunderbolt<a href="#note29" id="anchor29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; but if he thought badly
of Littleton, he thought badly of Tribonian
also, and would have been the last man to
preach a Reception. Professor Alberigo Gentili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of Oxford, he too was protestant enough and
could rail at the canonists by the hour; but
then he as an Italian had a bitter feud with
the French humanizers, and stood up for the
medieval gloss<a href="#note30" id="anchor30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>Plainly the story is not simple and we must
hurry past it. Still the perplexity of detail
should not obscure the broad truth that there
was pleasant reading in the Byzantine Code for
a king who wished to be monarch in church as
well as state: pleasanter reading than could
be found in our ancient English law-books.
Surely Erastianism is a bad name for the theory
that King Henry approved: Marsilianism seems
better, but Byzantinism seems best<a href="#note31" id="anchor31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. A time
had come when, medieval spectacles being discarded,
men could see with the naked eye what
stood in the Code and Novels of Constantinople.
In 1558 on the eve of an explosive Reformation
‘the Protestants of Scotland,’ craving ‘remedy
against the tyranny of the estate ecclesiastical,’
demanded that the controversy should be judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by the New Testament, the ancient fathers ‘and
the godly approved laws of Justinian the emperor<a href="#note32" id="anchor32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.’
University-bred jurists, even such as
came from an oldish school, were very serviceable
to King Henry in the days of the great
divorce case and the subsequent quarrel with
the papacy. Tunstall, Gardiner, Bonner, Sampson
and Clerk, to say nothing of the Leghs and
Laytons, were doctors of law and took their fees
in bishoprics and deaneries<a href="#note33" id="anchor33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Certainly they
were more conspicuous and probably they were
much abler men than those who were sitting in
the courts of the common law. With the one
exception of Anthony Fitzherbert, the judges
of Henry’s reign are not prominent in our legal
history, and we have little reason for attributing
deep knowledge of any sort of law to such
chancellors as Audley, Wriothesley and Rich.
I doubt our common lawyers easily accommodated
themselves to ecclesiastical changes.
Some years after Elizabeth’s accession the
number of barristers who were known to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
government as ‘papists’ was surprisingly large
and it included the great Plowden<a href="#note34" id="anchor34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. But we
must go back to our main theme.</p>

<p>A Reception there was not to be, nor dare
I say that a Reception was what our Regius
Professor or his royal patron desired. As to
Smith himself, it is fairly evident that some
time afterwards, when he had resigned his chair
and was Elizabeth’s ambassador at the French
court, he was well content to contrast the public
law of England with that of ‘France, Italy,
Spain, Germany and all other countries which’
to use his words ‘do follow the civil law of the
Romans compiled by Justinian into his Pandects
and Code<a href="#note35" id="anchor35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.’ The little treatise on the Commonwealth
of England which he wrote at Toulouse
in 1565&mdash;a remarkable feat for he had no English
books at hand<a href="#note36" id="anchor36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;became a classic in the next
century, and certainly did not underrate those
traditional, medieval, Germanic and parliamentary
elements which were still to be found in
English life and law under the fifth and last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the Tudors. Nevertheless I think that a well-equipped
lecturer might persuade a leisurely
audience to perceive that in the second quarter
of the sixteenth century the continuity of English
legal history was seriously threatened<a href="#note37" id="anchor37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>Unquestionably our medieval law was open
to humanistic attacks. It was couched partly
in bad Latin, partly in worse French. For the
business Latin of the middle age there is much
to be said. It is a pleasant picture that which
we have of Thomas More puzzling the omniscient
foreigner by the question ‘An averia
carucae capta in withernamio sunt irreplegibilia<a href="#note38" id="anchor38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.’
He asked a practical question in the
only Latin in which that question could have
been asked without distortion. Smith’s acute
glance saw that <i>withernamium</i> must have something
to do with the German <i lang="de">wiedernehmen</i>;
for among his other pursuits our professor had
interested himself in the study of English
words<a href="#note39" id="anchor39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. But this business Latin was a pure
and elegant language when compared with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
served our lawyers as French. Pole and Smith
might well call it barbarous; that it was fast
becoming English was its one redeeming feature.
You are likely to know what I must not call the
classical passage: it comes from the seventeenth
century. In all the <cite lang="la">Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</cite>
there is nothing better than the report
which tells how one of Sir Robert Rede’s
successors was assaulted by a prisoner ‘que
puis son condemnation ject un brickbat a le dit
justice que narrowly mist<a href="#note40" id="anchor40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.’ It is as instructive
as it is surprising that this jargon should have
been written in a country where Frenchmen had
long been regarded as hereditary foes. This
prepares us for the remark that taught law is
tough law. But when ‘Dunce’ had been set in
Bocardo (and it was a doctor of the civil law
who set him there<a href="#note41" id="anchor41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>), why should the old law
books be spared? They also were barbarous;
they also were sufficiently papistical.</p>

<p>Turning to a more serious aspect of affairs,
it would not I think be difficult to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the pathway for a Reception was prepared.
Not difficult but perhaps wearisome. At this
point it is impossible for us to forget that the
year 1485, if important to students of English
history for other reasons, is lamentably important
for this reason, that there Dr Stubbs laid
down his pen. In his power of marshalling
legal details so as to bring to view some living
principle or some phase of national development
he has had no rival and no second among
Englishmen. Howbeit, we may think of the
subjected church and the humbled baronage, of
the parliament which exists to register the royal
edicts, of the English <cite lang="la">Lex Regia</cite> which gives the
force of statute to the king’s proclamations<a href="#note42" id="anchor42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, of
the undeniable faults of the common law, of its
dilatory methods, of bribed and perjured juries,
of the new courts which grow out of the King’s
Council and adopt a summary procedure devised
by legists and decretists. Might not the Council
and the Star Chamber and the Court of Requests&mdash;courts
not tied and bound by ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
formalism,&mdash;do the romanizing work that was
done in Germany by the Imperial Chamber
Court, the <cite lang="de">Reichskammergericht</cite><a href="#note43" id="anchor43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>? This was the
time when King Henry’s nephew James V was
establishing a new court in Scotland, a College
of Justice, and Scotland was to be the scene of
a Reception<a href="#note44" id="anchor44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p>It seems fairly certain that, besides all that
he effected, Henry had at times large projects
in his mind: a project for a great college of
law (possibly a College of Justice in the Scotch
sense), a project for the reformation of the Inns
of Court, which happily were not rich enough to
deserve dissolution<a href="#note45" id="anchor45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, also perhaps a project for
a civil code as well as the better known project
for a code ecclesiastical. In Edward VI’s day
our Regius and German Professor of Divinity,
Dr Martin Butzer, had heard, so it seems, that
such a scheme had been taken in hand, and he
moved in circles that were well informed. He
urged the young Josiah to go forward in the
good work; he denounced the barbarism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
English law and (to use Bentham’s word) its
incognoscibility<a href="#note46" id="anchor46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. The new ecclesiastical code,
as is generally known, was never enacted; but
we know equally well that the draft is in print.
Its admired Latinity is ascribed to Prof. Smith’s
immediate successor, Dr Walter Haddon. I
take it that now-a-days few English clergymen
wish that they were living&mdash;or should I not say
dying?&mdash;under Dr Haddon’s pretty phrases<a href="#note47" id="anchor47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
Codification was in the air. Both in France
and in Germany the cry for a new Justinian was
being raised, and perhaps we may say that only
because a new Justinian was not forthcoming,
men endeavoured to make the best that they
could of the old<a href="#note48" id="anchor48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. How bad that best would
be Francis Hotman foretold.</p>

<p>And then we see that in 1535, the year in
which More was done to death, the Year Books
come to an end: in other words, the great
stream of law reports that has been flowing for
near two centuries and a half, ever since the
days of Edward I, becomes discontinuous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
then runs dry. The exact significance of this
ominous event has never yet been duly explored;
but ominous it surely is<a href="#note49" id="anchor49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Some words
that once fell from Edmund Burke occur to us:
‘To put an end to reports is to put an end to
the law of England<a href="#note50" id="anchor50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.’ Then in 1547 just after
King Henry’s death a wail went up from ‘divers
students of the common laws.’ The common
laws, they said, were being set aside in favour
of ‘the law civil’ insomuch that the old courts
had hardly any business<a href="#note51" id="anchor51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. Ten years later, at
the end of Mary’s reign, we read that the judges
had nothing to do but ‘to look about them,’ and
that for the few practitioners in Westminster
Hall there was ‘elbow room enough<a href="#note52" id="anchor52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.’ In
criminal causes that were of any political importance
an examination by two or three doctors
of the civil law threatened to become a normal
part of our procedure<a href="#note53" id="anchor53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. In short, I am persuaded
that in the middle years of the sixteenth
century and of the Tudor age the life of our
ancient law was by no means lusty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we may ask what opposing force,
what conservative principle was there in England?
National character, the genius of a
people, is a wonder-working spirit which stands
at the beck and call of every historian. But
before we invoke it on the present occasion we
might prudently ask our books whether in the
sixteenth century the bulk of our German
cousins inherited an innate bias towards what
they would have called a Welsh jurisprudence.
There seems to be plentiful evidence that the
learned <i lang="la">doctores iuris</i> who counselled the German
princes and obtained seats in the courts were
cordially detested by the multitude. In modern
times they often have to bear much blame for
that terrible revolt which we know as the
Peasants’ War<a href="#note54" id="anchor54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. No doubt there were many
differences between England and Germany, between
England and France, between England
and Scotland<a href="#note55" id="anchor55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Let us notice one difference
which, if I am not mistaken, marked off England
from the rest of the world. Medieval England
had schools of national law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The importance of certain law schools will
be readily conceded, even to one who is in
some sort officially bound to believe that law
schools may be important. A history of civilization
would be miserably imperfect if it took
no account of the first new birth of Roman law
in the Bologna of Irnerius. Indeed there are
who think that no later movement,&mdash;not the
Renaissance, not the Reformation&mdash;draws a
stronger line across the annals of mankind than
that which is drawn about the year 1100 when
a human science won a place beside theology.
I suppose that the importance of the school of
Bourges would also be conceded. It may be
worth our while to remark that the school of
Bologna had a precursor in the school of Pavia,
and that the law which was the main subject of
study in the Pavia of the eleventh century was
not Roman law but Lombard law: a body of
barbaric statutes that stood on one level with
the Anglo-Saxon laws of the same age. This
I say, not in order that I may remind you what
sort of law it was that Archbishop Lanfranc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
studied when as a young man he was a shining
light in the school of Pavia, but because this
body of Lombard law, having once become the
subject of systematic study, showed a remarkable
vitality in its struggle with Roman jurisprudence.
Those Italian doctors of the middle age who
claimed for their science the fealty of all mankind
might have been forced to admit that all
was not well at home. They might call this
Lombard law <i lang="la">ius asininum</i> and the law of brute
beasts, but it lingered on, and indeed I read
that it was not utterly driven from the kingdom
of Naples until Joseph Bonaparte published the
French code. Law schools make tough law<a href="#note56" id="anchor56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>Very rarely do we see elsewhere the academic
teaching of any law that is not Roman: imperially
or papally Roman. As a matter of course
the universities had the two legal faculties,
unless, as at Paris, the Pope excluded the legists
from an ecclesiastical preserve. The voice of
John Wyclif pleading that English law was the
law that should be taught in English universities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was a voice that for centuries cried in the
wilderness. It was 1679 before French law obtained
admission into the French universities<a href="#note57" id="anchor57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.
It was 1709 before Georg Beyer, a pandectist
at Wittenberg, set a precedent for lectures on
German law in a German university<a href="#note58" id="anchor58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. It was
1758 before Blackstone began his ever famous
course at Oxford. The chair that I cannot
fill was not established until the transatlantic
Cambridge was setting an example to her elderly
mother<a href="#note59" id="anchor59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. But then, throughout the later middle
age English law had been academically taught.</p>

<p>No English institutions are more distinctively
English than the Inns of Court; of none
is the origin more obscure. We are only now
coming into possession of the documents whence
their history must be gathered, and apparently
we shall never know much of their first days<a href="#note60" id="anchor60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
Unchartered, unprivileged, unendowed, without
remembered founders, these groups of lawyers
formed themselves and in course of time evolved
a scheme of legal education: an academic scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the medieval sort, oral and disputatious. For
good and ill that was a big achievement: a big
achievement in the history of some undiscovered
continents. We may well doubt whether aught
else could have saved English law in the age
of the Renaissance. What is distinctive of
medieval England is not parliament, for we may
everywhere see assemblies of Estates, nor trial
by jury, for this was but slowly suppressed in
France. But the Inns of Court and the Year
Books that were read therein, we shall hardly
find their like elsewhere. At all events let
us notice that where Littleton and Fortescue
lectured, there Robert Rede lectures, Thomas
More lectures, Edward Coke lectures, Francis
Bacon lectures, and highly technical were the
lectures that Francis Bacon gave. Now it would,
so I think, be difficult to conceive any scheme
better suited to harden and toughen a traditional
body of law than one which, while books were
still uncommon, compelled every lawyer to take
part in legal education and every distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
lawyer to read public lectures. That was what
I meant when I made bold to say that Robert
Rede was not only an English judge but ‘what
is more’ a reader in English law.</p>

<p><i lang="la">Deus bone!</i> exclaimed Professor Smith in his
inaugural lecture, and what excited the learned
doctor to this outcry was the skill in disputation
shown by the students of English law in their
schools at London. He was endeavouring to
persuade his hearers that in many ways the
study of law would improve their minds. If,
he urged, these young men, cut off as they are
from all the humanities, can reason thus over
their ‘barbaric and semi-gallic laws,’ what might
not you, you cultivated scholars do if you
studied the Digest and Alciatus and Zasius?
And then the professor expressed a hope that
he might be able to spend his vacation in the
Inns of Court<a href="#note61" id="anchor61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. His heart was in the right
place: in a school of living law. Even for the
purposes of purely scientific observation the live
dog may be better than the dead lion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>When the middle of the century is past the
signs that English law has a new lease of life
become many. The medieval books poured
from the press, new books were written, the
decisions of the courts were more diligently
reported, the lawyers were boasting of the independence
and extreme antiquity of their system<a href="#note62" id="anchor62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.
We were having a little Renaissance of our
own: or a gothic revival if you please. The
Court of Requests in which Prof. Smith and
Prof. Haddon had done justice was being tried
for its life. Its official defender was, we observe,
Italian by blood and Parisian by degree:
Dr Adelmare, known to Englishmen as Sir
Julius Caesar<a href="#note63" id="anchor63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. That wonderful Edward Coke
was loose. The medieval tradition was more
than safe in his hands. You may think it
pleasant to turn from this masterful, masterless
man to his great rival. It is not very safe to
say what Thomas More did not know, less safe
to say what was unknown to Francis Bacon, but
I cannot discover that either of these scholars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
these philosophers, these statesmen, these law
reformers, these schemers of ideal republics,
these chancellors of the realm, these law lecturers,
had more than a bowing acquaintance
with Roman law.</p>

<p>If Reginald Pole’s dream had come true, if
there had been a Reception&mdash;well, I have not
the power to guess and you have not the time
to hear what would have happened; but I think
that we should have had to rewrite a great deal
of history. For example, in the seventeenth
century there might have been a struggle between
king and parliament, but it would hardly
have been that struggle for the medieval, the
Lancastrian, constitution in which Coke and
Selden and Prynne and other ardent searchers
of mouldering records won their right to be
known to school-boys. In 1610 when the conflict
was growing warm a book was burnt by the
common hangman: it was written by an able
man in whom Cambridge should take some
pride, Dr Cowell, our Regius Professor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
seemed to confirm the suspicion that Roman
law and absolute monarchy went hand in hand<a href="#note64" id="anchor64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>The profit and loss account would be a long
affair. I must make no attempt to state it. If
there was the danger of barbarism and stupidity
on the one side, there was the danger of pedantry
on the other: the pedantry that endeavours to
appropriate the law of another race and galvanizes
a dead Corpus Juris into a semblance of
life. Since the first of January 1900 the attempt
to administer law out of Justinian’s books has
been abandoned in Germany. The so-called
‘Roman-Dutch’ law of certain outlying parts
of the British Empire now stands alone<a href="#note65" id="anchor65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, and
few, I imagine, would foretell for it a brilliant
future, unless it passes into the hand of the
codifier and frankly ceases to be nominally
Roman. Let us observe, however, that much
had been at stake in the little England of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1606 Coke was settling the first charter of
Virginia<a href="#note66" id="anchor66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. In 1619 elected ‘burgesses’ from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
various ‘hundreds’ of Virginia were assembling,
and the first-born child of the mother of parliaments
saw the light<a href="#note67" id="anchor67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Maryland was granted
to Lord Baltimore with view of frankpledge and
all that to view of frankpledge doth belong, to
have and to hold in free and common socage as
of the castle of Windsor in the county of Berks,
yielding yearly therefor two Indian arrows of
those parts on the Tuesday in Easter week<a href="#note68" id="anchor68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.
The port and island of Bombay in one hemisphere<a href="#note69" id="anchor69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>,
and in another Prince Rupert’s land
stretching no one knew how far into the frozen
north were detached members of the manor of
East Greenwich in the county of Kent<a href="#note70" id="anchor70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. Nearly
twenty-five hundred copies of Blackstone’s Commentaries
were absorbed by the colonies on the
Atlantic seaboard before they declared their
independence. James Kent, aged fifteen, found
a copy, and (to use his own words) was inspired
with awe<a href="#note71" id="anchor71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>; John Marshall found a copy in his
father’s library<a href="#note72" id="anchor72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; and the common law went
straight to the Pacific<a href="#note73" id="anchor73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>A hundred legislatures&mdash;little more or less&mdash;are
now building on that foundation: on the
rock that was not submerged. We will not say
this boastfully. Far from it. Standing at the
beginning of a century and in the first year of
Edward VII, thinking of the wide lands which
call him king, thinking of our complex and
loosely-knit British Commonwealth, we cannot
look into the future without serious misgivings.
If unity of law&mdash;such unity as there has been&mdash;disappears,
much else that we treasure will disappear
also, and (to speak frankly) unity of law
is precarious. The power of the parliament of
the United Kingdom to legislate for the colonies
is fast receding into the ghostly company of legal
fictions. Men of our race have been litigious;
the great Ihering admired our litigiousness<a href="#note74" id="anchor74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; it
is one of our more amiable traits; but it seems
to me idle to believe that distant parts of the
earth will supply a tribunal at Westminster
with enough work to secure uniformity. The
so-called common law of one colony will swerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
from that of another, and both from that of
England. Some colonies will have codes<a href="#note75" id="anchor75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. If
English lawyers do not read Australian reports
(and they cannot read everything), Australian
lawyers will not much longer read English
reports.</p>

<p>Still the case is not yet desperate. Heroic
things can be done by a nation which means to
do them: as witness the mighty effort of science
and forbearance which in our own time has
unified the law of Germany, and, having handed
over the Corpus Juris to the historians, has in
some sort undone the work of the Reception<a href="#note76" id="anchor76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
Some venerable bodies may understand the
needs of the time, or, if I may borrow a famous
phrase, ‘the vocation of our age for jurisprudence
and legislation.’ Our parliament may
endeavour to put out work which will be a
model for the British world. It can still set
an example where it can no longer dictate, and
at least it might clear away the rubbish that
collects round every body of law. To make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
law that is worthy of acceptance by free communities
that are not bound to accept it, this
would be no mean ambition. <i lang="la">Nihil aptius, nihil
efficacius ad plures provincias sub uno imperio
retinendas et fovendas</i><a href="#note77" id="anchor77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. But it is hardly to
parliament that our hopes must turn in the
first instance. Certain ancient and honourable
societies, proud of a past that is unique in the
history of the world, may become fully conscious
of the heavy weight of responsibility that was
assumed when English law schools saved, but
isolated, English law in the days of the Reception.
In that case, the glory of Bourges, the
glory of Bologna, the glory of Harvard may
yet be theirs<a href="#note78" id="anchor78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<p>Andrea Alciato was born at Alzate near Milan
in 1492, studied at Pavia and Bologna, in 1518 was
called to teach at Avignon, went to Milan in 1520,
to Bourges in 1528, was afterwards at Pavia,
Bologna and Ferrara, died at Pavia in 1550
(Pertile, <cite lang="it">Storia del diritto italiano</cite>, ed. 2, vol. <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> (2),
p. 428). Ulrich Zäsi was born in 1461, studied at
Tübingen and at Freiburg where he became town-clerk
and afterwards professor of law, died in 1535.
See Stintzing, <cite>Ulrich Zasius</cite>, Basel, 1857, where
(pp. 162-216) the intercourse between Erasmus,
Zäsi, Alciato and Budé is described. The early
Italian humanists had looked on jurisprudence
with disdain and disgust. See Geiger, <cite lang="de">Renaissance
und Humanismus</cite>, 1882, pp. 500-503; Voigt, <cite lang="de">Die
Wiederbelebung des classischen Alterthums</cite>, ed. 3,
vol. <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, pp. 477-484. Gradually, so I understand,
philologians such as Budé (d. 1540) began to discover
that there was matter interesting to them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the Corpus Juris, and a few jurists turned towards
the new classical learning. See Tilley, <cite>Humanism
under Francis I.</cite>, in <cite>English Historical Review</cite>,
vol. <span class="smcapuc">XV.</span>, pp. 456 ff. In 1520 Zäsi, writing to
Alciato, said ‘All sciences have put off their dirty
clothes: only jurisprudence remains in her rags.’

from Catherine and the consequent breach with
Rome. The negotiation failed, but Starkey took
the opportunity of laying before Henry a dialogue
which he (Starkey) had composed. The interlocutors
in this dialogue were Pole and the well-known
scholar Thomas Lupset, and Pole was
represented as expounding his opinions touching
political and ecclesiastical affairs. How far at all
points Starkey fairly represented Pole’s views may
be doubted. Still we have respectable evidence
that Pole had talked in the strain of the following
passage, and at any rate Starkey thought that in
King Henry’s eyes he was befriending Pole by
making him speak thus.</p>

<p>‘Thys ys no dowte but that our law and ordur

without ordur or end. Ther ys no stabyl grounde
therin, nor sure stay; but euery one that can coloure
reson makyth a stope to the best law that ys before
tyme deuysyd. The suttylty of one sergeant schal
enerte [enerve?] and destroy al the jugementys
of many wyse men before tyme receyuyd. There
is no stabyl ground in our commyn law to leyne
vnto. The jugementys of yerys [<i>i.e.</i> the Year

and, besyde that, of smal authoryte. The jugys
are not bounden, as I vnderstond, to folow them as
a rule, but aftur theyr owne lyberty they haue
authoryte to juge, accordyng as they are instructyd
by the sergeantys, and as the cyrcumstance of the
cause doth them moue. And thys makyth jugementys
and processe of our law to be wythout
end and infynyte; thys causyth sutys to be long
in decysyon. Therefor, to remedy thys mater
groundly, hyt were necessary, in our law, to vse
the same remedy that Justynyan dyd in the law of
the Romaynys, to bryng thys infynyte processe to
certayn endys, to cut away thys long lawys, and,
by the wysdome of some polytyke and wyse men,
instytute a few and bettur lawys and ordynancys.

seruyth them to no purpos at al; and, besyde that,
to say the truth, many of the lawys themselfys be
also barbarouse and tyrannycal, as you haue before
hard. [Here follows an attack on primogeniture

<div class="sidenote">Reception of the civil law recommended.</div>

<p>Lupset thereupon objects that, seeing we have so
many years been governed by our own law, it will
be hard to bring this reform to pass. Pole replies
that the goodness of a prince would bring it to pass
quickly: ‘the wych I pray God we may onys see.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pole and the reform of the land laws.</div>

<p>The Pole of the Dialogue wished to make the
power to entail lands a privilege of the nobility.
A project of this kind had been in the air: perhaps
in King Henry’s mind. See <cite>Letters and Papers,
Henry VIII.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>, pt. 2, p. 2693 (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1529):
‘Draft bill … proposing to enact that from 1 Jan.
next all entails be annulled and all possessions be
held in fee simple.… The Act is not to affect the
estates of noblemen within the degree of baron.’
This is one of the proposals for restoring the king’s
feudal revenue which lead up to the Statute of
Uses: an Act whose embryonic history has not yet
been written, though Dr Stubbs has thrown out
useful hints. (<cite>Seventeen Lectures</cite>, ed. 3, p. 321.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Starkey’s legal studies.</div>

<p>When Pole left England in 1532 he went to
Avignon where Alciato had lately been lecturing
and became for a short while a pupil of Giovanni
Francesco Ripa (Zimmermann, <cite lang="de">Kardinal Pole</cite>,
1893, p. 51), who was both canonist and legist.
Whether at any time Pole made a serious study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the civil law I do not know. In 1534 Pole and
Starkey were together at Padua; Pole was studying
theology, Starkey the civil law. Starkey in a letter
says ‘Francis Curtius is dead, to the grief of those
who follow the doctrine of Bartholus.’ Perhaps we
may infer from this that Starkey was in the
camp of the Anti-Bartolists (<cite>Letters and Papers,
Henry VIII.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span>, p. 331). In 1535 he says
that he has been studying the civil law in order to
form ‘a better judgment of the politic order and
customs used in our country’ (<cite>Ibid.</cite> vol. <span class="smcapuc">VIII.</span>,

<p>Despite a doubt suggested by Stubbs (<cite>Seventeen
Lectures</cite>, ed. 3, p. 368), I cannot believe that the
slightest hint of a degree in canon law lurks at
Cambridge in the title ‘<span lang="la">Legum Doctor</span>’ (LL.D.):
not even ‘a shadowy presentment of the double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
honour.’ See E. C. Clark, <cite>Cambridge Legal Studies</cite>,
1888, pp. 56 ff., where that title is well explained.
On the continent a settled usage contrasted
the <i lang="la">doctores legum</i> and the <i lang="la">doctores decretorum</i>.
See e.g. Stintzing, <cite lang="de">Geschichte der deutschen Rechtswissenschaft</cite>,

Legisten und Decretisten verschiedene Schulen

is, I suppose, Arnaud Ferrier, the master of

has given an excellent summary. The following
passage is that in which the Professor approaches
the question whether in England there is a career
open to the civilian. He has been saying that we
ought not to study merely for the sake of riches.
‘<span lang="la">Tamen si qui sint qui hoc requirant, sunt archiva
Londini, sunt pontificia fora, forum est praefecti
quoque classis, in quibus proclamare licet et vocem
vendere; est scriptura; singuli pontifices cancellarios
suos habent et officiales et commissarios, qui propter
civilis et pontificii iuris professionem in hunc locum
accipiuntur.</span>’ The orator proceeds to ask whether
there is any youth who ungratefully thinks that
proficiency in legal science will not find an adequate
reward. ‘<span lang="la">In quo regno aut in cuius regis imperio
tam stulta illum opinio tenebit? In hoccine nobilissimi
atque invictissimi nostri principis Henrici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

studiumque in literatos, omnium omnis memoriae
principum facta meritaque superavit, cuius ingentia
in academias beneficia, licet nulla unquam tacebit
posteritas, tamen omni celebratione maiora reperientur.
Cum strenue laboraveris et periculum
ingenii tui feceris, teque non lusisse operam sed
dignum aliquo operae precio et honore ostenderis,
cur dejicies animum? Cur desperatione conflictabis?
Cur de tanto fautore ingeniorum, tam insigni bonae

<div class="sidenote">Diplomacy and the civil law.</div>

<p>There follows much more flattery of the king as
a patron of learning of every kind. ‘<span lang="la">Iuris quidem
civilis consulti facultas in hac republica cum ad
multos usus pernecessaria est, tum a principe
nostro nequaquam negligi aut levem haberi, vel hoc
argumento esse potest, quod tam amplo planeque
regio stipendio et meam hic apud vos mediocritatem
et alium Oxonii disertum ac doctum virum ius hoc
civile praelegere profiterique voluit.</span>’ And the study
of the civil law is the high road to diplomatic service.
‘<span lang="la">Ius vero civile sic est commune ut cum ex Anglia
discesseris, nobiles, ignobiles, docti, indocti, sacerdotes
etiam ac monachi cum aliquod specimen
eruditionis videri volunt exhibuisse, nihil fere aliud
perstrepunt quam quod ex hoc iure civili et pontificio
sit depromptum.</span>’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rewards for civilians.</div>

<p>The king has wisely
employed civilians in his many legations. There
follow compliments paid to Stephen Gardiner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Thomas Thirlby, William Paget, Thomas Wriothesley,
and Thomas Legh. On the whole, the
professor can hold out to his pupils the prospect of
diplomatic employment, of masterships in the
chancery (‘<span lang="la">sunt archiva Londini</span>’), of practice in
the ecclesiastical courts and the court of admiralty,
and besides this they are to remember that the
king is a great patron of learning. I do not see
any hint that knowledge of Roman law will help a
man at the bar of the ordinary English courts.</p>

<p>For more of the attempt to put new life into the
study of Roman law at Cambridge, see Mullinger,
<cite>op. cit.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, pp. 132 ff. Though Somerset
desired to see a great civil law college which
should be a nursery for diplomatists, the Edwardian
or Protestant Reformation of the church was in
one way very unfavourable to the study of the
civil law. Bishoprics and deaneries were thenceforth
reserved for divines, and thus what had been
the prizes of his profession were placed beyond the
jurist’s reach. Dr Nicholas Wotton (d. 1567), dean
of Canterbury and York, may be regarded as one
of the last specimens of an expiring race. Men
who were not professionally learned, men like
Sir Francis Bryan (d. 1550) and Sir Thomas Wyatt
(d. 1542), had begun to compete with the doctors
for diplomatic missions and appointments. Also
the chancellorship of the realm had come within
the ambition of the common lawyer, and (though
Bishop Goodrich may be one instance to the
contrary) the policy which would commit the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
seal to the hands of a prelate was the policy which
would resist or reverse ecclesiastical innovations.
Even the mastership of the rolls, which had been
held by doctors of Padua and Bologna, fell to
the common lawyers. Thomas Hannibal, master
of the rolls (1523-1527), must, one would think,
have been an Italian, as were the king’s Latin
secretaries Andrea Ammonio and Pietro Vannes.</p>

Leipz. 1822, p. 162; Haag, <cite lang="fr">La France protestante</cite>,
ed. 2, vol. <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>, col. 957-970). Doneau was a
Calvinist; driven from France by Catholics and
from Heidelberg by Lutherans, he went to Leyden
and ultimately to Altdorf. Hotman was a Calvinist,
intimately connected with the church of Geneva.
Baudouin was compelled to leave France for
Geneva, whence he went to Strassburg and Heidelberg;
but he quarrelled with Calvin and was
accused of changing his religion six times. Charles
Du Moulin also had been an exile at Tübingen.
It is said that after a Calvinistic stage he became
a Lutheran; on his death-bed he returned to
Catholicism: such at least was the tale told by
Catholics. (See Brodeau, <cite lang="fr">La vie de Maistre Charles
Du Molin</cite>, Paris, 1654; Haag, <cite lang="fr">La France protestante</cite>,
ed. 2, vol. <span class="smcapuc">V.</span>, col. 783-789.) To say the least,
he had been ‘ultra-gallican.’ (Schulte, <cite lang="de">Geschichte

p. viii, and in Dareste’s essay (p. 5). His son John
spent some time at Oxford. In 1583 John tells his
father that at Oxford he has plenty of time for
study ‘<span lang="la">quamvis hic miris modis frigeat iuris civilis
studium et mea hac in re opera nemini grata possit
esse in Anglia</span>’ (<cite lang="la">Hotomanorum Epistolae</cite>, Amstd.,
1620, p. 325). In 1584 John was consulted along
with Alberigo Gentili by the English government
in the Mendoza case (Holland, <cite lang="la">Albericus Gentilis</cite>,
pp. 14, 15). There is nothing improbable in the
story that Francis was offered a post at Oxford.
He must have been well known to Cecil. In 1562
he was active in bringing Condé into touch with
Elizabeth and so in promoting the expedition to
Havre. Condé’s envoy brought to Cecil a letter
of introduction from Hotman (<cite>Foreign Calendar</cite>,
1561-2, p. 601). Baudouin also at this time was
making himself useful to the English government.
(See e.g. <cite>Foreign Calendar</cite>, 1558-9, p. 173; 1561-2,
pp. 60, 367, 454, 481, 510.) It has been said that
Queen Elizabeth spoke of Charles Du Moulin as
her kinsman (Brodeau, <cite lang="fr">Vie de C. Du Molin</cite>, p. 4).
Whether in the pedigree of the Boleyns there is
any ground for this story I do not know. See <cite lang="fr">La
France protestante</cite>, ed. 2, vol. <span class="smcapuc">V.</span>, col. 783. Sir
Thomas Craig, who is an important figure in the
history of Scotch law, sat at the feet of Baudouin,
and Edward Henryson, who in 1566 became a lord
of session, had been a professor at Bourges (<cite>Dict.

still finds admirers among students of French prose.
Apparently Hotman would have been the last man
to preach a Reception of Roman law in England.
Being keenly alive to the faults of Justinian’s books,
he resisted the further romanization of French law,
demanded a national code, admired the English
limited monarchy, and by his <cite lang="fr">Franco-Gallia</cite> made
himself in some sort the ancestor of the ‘Germanists.’
Some of these ‘elegant’ French jurists were
so much imbued with the historical spirit that in
their hands the study of Roman law became the
study of an ancient history. The following words
cited and translated by Dareste from Baudouin
(<cite lang="fr">François Hotman</cite>, p. 19) have a wonderfully
modern sound: ‘<span lang="fr">Ceux qui ont étudié le droit
auraient pu trouver dans l’histoire la solution de
bien des difficultés, et ceux qui ont écrit l’histoire
auraient mieux fait d’étudier le développement des
lois et des institutions, que de s’attacher à passer
en revue les armées, à décrire les camps, à raconter
les batailles, à compter les morts.’ ‘<i lang="la">Sine historia
caecam esse iurisprudentiam</i>, disait Baudouin.</span>’

commentarius</cite> (F. Hotmani Opera, ed. 1599, vol. <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
p. 913) s.v. <i lang="la">feodum</i>. Hotman remarks that the
English use the word <em>fee</em> (<span lang="la">longissime tamen a
Langobardici iuris ratione et instituto</span>) to signify
‘<span lang="la">praedia omnia quae perpetuo iure tenentur</span>.’ He
then adds that Stephanus Pasquerius (the famous
Étienne Pasquier) had given him Littleton’s book:
‘<span lang="la">ita incondite, absurde et inconcinne scriptum, ut
facile appareat verissimum esse quod Polydorus
Virgilius in Anglica Historia de iure Anglicano
testatus est, stultitiam in eo libro cum malitia et
calumniandi studio certare.</span>’ To a foreign ‘feudist’
Littleton’s book would seem absurd enough, because
in England the <i lang="la">feudum</i> had become the general
form in which all land-ownership appeared. Brunner
(<cite lang="de">Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, p. 11) puts
this well: ‘<span lang="de">Wo jedes Grundeigentum sich in Lehn

<div class="sidenote">Polydore Virgil.</div>

<p>I have not found in Polydore Virgil’s History
anything about Littleton. There is a passage
however in lib. <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span> (ed. Basil. 1556, p. 154) in
which he denounces the unjust laws imposed by
William the Conqueror and (so he says) still
observed in his own day: ‘<span lang="la">Non possum hoc loco
non memorare rem tametsi omnibus notam, admiratione
tamen longe dignissimam, atque dictu
incredibilem: eiusmodi namque leges quae ab

Norman iniquity is trial by jury, which Polydore
cannot find in the laws of Alfred. This Italian
historiographer may well be speaking what was
felt by many Englishmen in Henry VIII’s day
when he holds up to scorn and detestation ‘<span lang="la">illud

‘mere grammarian.’ By expelling such men as
the Gentilis, Italy forfeited her pre-eminence in
the world of legal study. Nevertheless it is said
that both in France and Germany the practical
Roman law of the courts was for a long time the
law of the ‘Bartolist’ tradition. Esmein (<cite lang="fr">Histoire

Engl. Text Soc. 1878, p. xxv.) Chapuis (the imperial
ambassador at Henry’s court) to Charles V, 3 Jan.
1534 (<cite>Letters and Papers of Henry VIII.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span>,
p. 6): ‘The little pamphlet composed by the
Council, which I lately sent to your Majesty, is
only a preamble and prologue of others more important
which are now being printed. One is
called <cite lang="la">Defensorium Pacis</cite>, written in favour of
the emperor Loys of Bavaria against apostolic
authority. Formerly no one dared read it for fear
of being burnt, but now it is translated into English
so that all the people may see and understand it.’
William Marshall to Thomas Cromwell (<cite>Ibid.</cite>,
p. 178): ‘Whereas you promised to lend me £20
towards the printing of <cite lang="la">Defensor Pacis</cite>, which has
been translated this twelve-month, but kept from
the press for lack of money, in trust of your offer I
have begun to print it. I have made an end of the
Gift of Constantine and of Erasmus upon the Creed.’
The ‘Gift of Constantine’ must be the famous
treatise of Laurentius Valla. The translation of
Marsilius appeared on 27 July, 1535 (<cite>Dict. Nat.
Biog.</cite> s.n. William Marshall). In October twenty-four
copies had been distributed among the Carthusians
in London (<cite>Letters and Papers</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
p. 171). In 1536 Marshall complained that the
book had not sold, though it was the best book in
English against the usurped power of the bishop of
Rome (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">XI.</span>, p. 542). As to Byzantinism,
if it be an accident it is a memorable accident that
the strongest statement of King Henry’s divinely
instituted headship of the church occurs in a statute
which enables unordained doctors of the civil (not
canon) law to exercise that plenitude of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction which God has committed to the king
(<cite>Stat.</cite> 37 Hen. VIII., c. 17).</p>

<p id="note32"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor32">[32]</a></span> <cite>Foreign Calendar</cite>, 1558-9, p. 8. This seems
to mean that the normal and rightful relation of
church to state is that which is to be discovered in
Justinian’s books. If so, ‘the Protestants of Scotland’
soon afterwards changed their opinions under
the teaching of Geneva and claimed for ‘the estate

(afterwards bishop of Durham) ‘graduated LL.D. at
Padua.’ Stephen Gardiner (afterwards bishop of
Winchester) of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, ‘proceeded
doctor of the civil law in 1520 and of the canon
law in the following year.… In 1524 he was appointed
one of Sir Robert Rede’s lecturers in the University.’
Edmund Bonner of Broadgate Hall, Oxford, ‘in 1519
he took on two successive days (12 and 13 June) the
degrees of bachelor of civil and of canon law.… On
12 July, 1525, he was admitted doctor of civil law.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Thomas Thirlby (afterwards bishop of Ely) of
Trinity Hall, Cambridge, ‘graduated bachelor of
the civil law in 1521 … and proceeded doctor of the
civil law in 1528 and doctor of the canon law in
1530.’ Richard Sampson (afterwards bishop of
Lichfield) of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, ‘proceeded
B.C.L. in 1505. Then he went for six years to
Paris and Sens and returning proceeded D.C.L.
in 1513.’ John Clerk (afterwards bishop of Bath
and Wells, Master of the Rolls), ‘B.A. of Cambridge
1499 and M.A. 1502, studied law and received the
doctor’s degree at Bologna.’ Richard Layton (afterwards
dean of York) ‘was educated at Cambridge,
where he proceeded B.C.L. in 1522 and afterwards
LL.D.’ Thomas Legh of King’s College (?), Cambridge,
‘proceeded B.C.L. in 1527 and D.C.L. in
1531.’ Instances of legal degrees obtained in foreign
universities are not very uncommon. John Taylor,
Master of the Rolls in 1527, ‘graduated doctor of
law at some foreign university, being incorporated
at Cambridge in 1520 and at Oxford in 1522.’
James Denton, dean of Lichfield, proceeded B.A.
in 1489 and M.A. in 1492 at Cambridge. ‘He
subsequently studied canon law at Valencia in
which faculty he became a doctor of the university
there.’ (For an earlier instance, that of Thomas
Alcock of Bologna, see <cite>Grace Book A</cite>, Luard

<p>That wonderful divorce cause, which shook the
world, created a large demand for the sort of knowledge
that the university-bred jurist was supposed
to possess, especially as a great effort was made
to obtain from foreign doctors and universities
opinions favourable to the king. The famous Cambridge
‘Grecian’ Richard Croke was employed in
ransacking Italian libraries for the works of Greek
theologians and in taking council with Hebrew
rabbis. In Italy, France and Spain, as well as in
England, almost every canonist of distinction, from
the celebrated Philip Decius downwards, must have
made a little money out of that law suit, for the
emperor also wanted opinions.</p>

<p id="note37"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor37">[37]</a></span> From the time of Bracton to the present day
Englishmen have often allowed themselves phrases
which exaggerate the practical prevalence of Roman
law on the continent of Europe. Smith, for instance,
who had been in many parts of northern France and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was a learned and observant man, must have known
that (to use Voltaire’s phrase) he often changed
law when he changed horses and that the Estates
General had lately been demanding a unification of
the divergent customs (Viollet, <cite lang="fr">Histoire du droit
civil français</cite>, p. 202; Planiol, <cite lang="fr">Droit civil</cite>, 1900,
vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, p. 16). Germans, who know what an attempt
to administer Roman law really means, habitually
speak of French law as distinctively un-Roman.
Thus Rudolph Sohm (<cite lang="de">Fränkisches Recht und
römisches Recht</cite>, Weimar, 1880, p. 76): ‘<span lang="de">die Gesetzbücher
Napoleons I. zeigen, dass noch heute
wenigstens das Privatrecht und Processrecht Frankreichs
ein Abkömmling nicht des römischen, noch
des italienischen, sondern des fränkischen Rechtes
ist.</span>’ So Planiol (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, p. 26): ‘<span lang="fr">Deux
courants se sont trouvés en présence lors de l’unification
du droit français: l’esprit romain et les
traditions coutumières. Ce sont ces dernières qui
l’ont emporté. Le Code a été rédigé à Paris, en
plein pays coutumier; les conseillers d’État appartenaient
en majorité aux provinces septentrionales;
le parlement de Paris avait eu dans l’ancien droit
un rôle prépondérant. Il n’y a donc rien d’étonnant
à voir l’esprit des coutumes prédominer dans le
Code; le contraire eût été un non-sens historique.</span>’
Until the other day it was, I believe, a common
remark that the large part of Germany which stood
under the French code either in a translated or
untranslated form&mdash;and this part contained about
one-sixth of the Empire’s population&mdash;was the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of Germany in which the law was least Roman and
most Germanic. The division of France into two
great districts was not equal: before the acquisition
of Elsass from Germany ‘<span lang="fr">les pays de droit écrit
comprenaient à peine les deux cinquièmes de la
France</span>’ (Planiol, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, p. 11). See the
useful map in Brissaud, <cite lang="fr">Histoire du droit français</cite>,
p. 152. Even in the south there was much customary
law. A famous sentence in the custumal of
Bordeaux placed ‘the written law’ below ‘natural
reason’ (Viollet, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 150). Still it is not to
be denied that a slow process of romanization&mdash;very
different from the catastrophic Reception in
Germany&mdash;went on steadily for some five or six
centuries; and a system which as a whole seems
very un-Roman to a student of what became ‘the
common law’ of Germany may rightly seem Roman
to an Englishman. Francis Bacon knew that France
could not be compendiously described as a country
governed by the civil law. In his speech on the
Union of Laws (Spedding, <cite>Life and Letters</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">III.</span>,
p. 337) he accurately distinguishes ‘Gascoigne,
Languedock, Provence, Dolphinie’ which are
‘governed by the letter or text of the civil law’
from ‘the Isle of France, Tourayne, Berry, Anjou
and the rest, and most of all Brittain and Normandy,’
which are ‘governed by customs which
amount unto a municipal law, and use the civil law
but only for grounds and to decide new and rare
cases.’ English readers should at least know the
doctrine, strongly advocated in modern Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that the private law which was developed in England
by a French-speaking court was just one more
French <i lang="fr">coutume</i>. Sohm, <cite lang="de">Fränkisches Recht und

In France the Ordonnance of Villers-Cotterets
(1539) decreed that the judgments of the French
courts should be recorded no longer in Latin but in
French. ‘<span lang="fr">L’utilité de cette innovation … se comprend

<div class="sidenote">Civilians in councils and in courts.</div>

<p id="note43"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor43">[43]</a></span> The story (with which we are familiar in
England) of the evolution of various councils and
courts from an ancient <i lang="la">Curia Regis</i> seems to have
a close parallel in French history: so close that
imitation on one side or the other may at times be
suspected. After the <i lang="fr">parlement</i> with its various
chambers (which answer to our courts of common
law) has been established, the royal council interferes
with judicial matters in divers ways, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sections of the council become tribunals which
compete with the <i lang="fr">parlement</i>. (See, <i>e.g.</i> Esmein,
<cite lang="fr">Histoire du droit français</cite>, ed. 2, pp. 469 ff., and
the pedigree of courts and councils in Lavisse et
Rambaud, <cite lang="fr">Histoire générale</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>, p. 143; also
the pedigree in N. Valois, <cite lang="fr">Le conseil du roi</cite> (1888),
p. 11; and Brissaud, <cite lang="fr">Histoire du droit français</cite>,
pp. 816 ff.) In Germany the doctors of civil law
made their way first into councils and then into
courts. ‘<span lang="de">Die fremdrechtlich geschulten Juristen
wurden in Deutschland anfänglich nur in Verwaltungssachen
verwendet. Zur Rechtsprechung
gelangten sie dadurch, dass die Verwaltung diese
an sich zog, und zwar zuerst am Hofe des Königs</span>’
(Brunner, <cite lang="de">Grundzüge der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte</cite>,
1901, p. 227). In the England of Henry VIII’s day
there seems no little danger that <i lang="de">die fremdrechtlich
geschulten Juristen</i>, of whom there are a good many
in the king’s service, will gain the upper hand in
the new courts that have emerged from the council,
and will proceed from <i lang="de">Verwaltung</i> to <i lang="de">Rechtsprechung</i>.
There came a time when Dr Tunstall
(who got his law at Padua) was presiding over the
Council of the North and Dr Roland Lee over the
Council of the Marches. In 1538 Dr Lee, who was
endeavouring to bring Wales to order, said in a
letter to Cromwell, ‘If we should do nothing but
as the common law will, these things so far out of
order will never be redressed’ (<cite>Dict. Nat. Biog.</cite>,
vol. <span class="smcapuc">XXXII.</span>, p. 375).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Project for a new court.</div>

<p>In 1534 there was a project for the erection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
yet another new court. See <cite>Letters and Papers,
Henry VIII.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span>, p. 603: ‘Draft act of parliament
for the more rigid enforcement of previous
statutes, appointing a new court, to consist of six
discreet men, of whom three at least shall be outer
barristers in the Inns of Court, who shall be called
justices or conservators of the common weal and
sit together in the White Hall at Westminster or
elsewhere, with power to discuss all matters relating
to the common weal and to call before them all
persons who have violated any act of parliament
made since the beginning of Henry VIII.’s reign.’
If only three of these judges need be barristers,
what are the rest to be?</p>

<cite lang="la">Fortescutus Restitutus</cite>, 1663, pp. 539, 543.
In one of these Thomas Denton, Nicholas Bacon
and Robert Cary are answering an inquiry addressed
to them by Henry VIII touching the plan
of legal education pursued in the Inns of Court.
In this there are some phrases that tell of the
revival of learning. The writers thank Almighty
God for giving them a king ‘endued and adorned
himself with all kindes and sortes of good learning
as well divine as prophane’ and one who ‘purposeth
to set forward and as it were to revive the study
and perfect knowledge thereof [<i>i.e.</i> of good learning],
of long time detested and almost trodden under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
foot.’ They remark also that many good and
gentle wits have perished ‘chiefly for that most
of them in their tender years, indifferent to receive
both good and bad, were so rooted and seasoned,
as it were, in barbarous authors, very enemies to
good learning, that hard it was, yea almost impossible,
to reduce them to goodness.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king’s College of Law.</div>

<p>The other paper contains a project for the king’s
College of Law submitted by the same three writers.
This looks like an attempt to obtain a royally
endowed school of English law, and it is curious to
observe that, not English, but good French is to
take the place of bad French. ‘The inner barristers
shall plead in Latine, and the other barristers reason
in French; and either of them shall do what they
can to banish the corruption of both tongues.’ One
learned in French is ‘to teach the true pronuntiation
of the French tongue.’ One of excellent knowledge
in the Latin and Greek tongues is to read ‘some
orator or book of rhetoric, or else some other author
which treateth of the government of a commonwealth,
openly to all the company.’ Students of
this college are to be sent abroad to accompany
ambassadors, and two students are to act as historiographers
of the realm. Nothing is said of
the civil law. On the whole, this seems to be
a conservative proposal emanating from English
barristers for bettering the education of the common
lawyer, and thus rendering unnecessary such a
Reception as Pole had proposed. We do not know
that it represents Henry’s thoughts. It was ‘a civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
law college’ that Somerset wished to establish at
Cambridge by a fusion of Trinity Hall and Clare.

<div class="sidenote">The demand for Codification.</div>

<p id="note48"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor48">[48]</a></span> Commines attributes to Louis XI (<i lang="la">circ. an.</i>
1479) a project of reducing to uniformity all the
customs of France. Francis Bacon more than
once, when urging his schemes of law reform, referred
to Louis’s abortive project (Spedding, <cite>Life
and Letters</cite>, <span class="smcapuc">VI.</span> 66; <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> 362). Commines’s story
is not rejected by modern historians of French
law. The official redaction of the various ‘general
customs’ (customs of provinces) was commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in 1453 by the ordinance of Montils-les-Tours.
Little, however, was done in this matter until the
reigns of Charles VIII and Louis XII. Many
customs were redacted about the year 1510: that
of Orleans in 1509; that of Paris in 1510. This
might be described as a measure of codification:
‘<span lang="fr">elle fit, des coutumes, de véritables <em>lois écrites</em></span>’ or,
as we might say, statute law. (Esmein, <cite lang="fr">Histoire
du droit français</cite>, 746 ff.; Viollet, <cite lang="fr">Histoire du droit
français</cite>, 142 ff.; Planiol, <cite lang="fr">Droit civil</cite>, <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> 12, 16). Then
the Estates General at Orleans in 1560 in effect
demanded a general code: ‘<span lang="fr">Nous voulons une foy,
une loy, un roy</span>’ said the prolocutor of the clergy.
(Dareste, <cite>Hotman</cite>, p. 20.) Both Du Moulin and
Hotman recommended codification and apparently
thought that the task would not be difficult.
(Viollet, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 209; Dareste, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 21.)
Then as to Germany:&mdash;‘<span lang="de">An die Klagen über die
Verwirrung, in welche das Recht durch die scholastische
Wissenschaft gerathen ist, knüpft sich
seit dem Anfange des 16. Jahrhunderts regelmässig
das Verlangen, der Kaiser möge als ein neuer
Justinian das gemeine Recht des Reichs zur Einfachheit
und Klarheit gesetzlich reformiren.… Das
Verlangen nach einer Codification des gemeinen
Rechts zieht sich durch das ganze 16. Jahrhundert.</span>’
(Stintzing, <cite lang="de">Geschichte der deutschen Rechtswissenschaft</cite>,
vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, pp. 58-9.) In 1532 after a prolonged
effort the Empire actually came by a criminal
code, the so-called Carolina (<span lang="de"><span lang="la">Constitutio Carolina
Criminalis</span>; die peinliche Halsgerichtsordnung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Karls V.</span>), but its operation was confined by a
clause which sanctioned the ever increasing particularism
of the various states by saving their
ancient customs. (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, pp. 621 ff.) Within some
of these states or ‘territories’ there was in the
sixteenth century a good deal of comprehensive
legislation, amounting in some cases to the publication
of what we might call codes. A <i lang="de">Landrecht</i>
(to be contrasted with <i lang="de">Reichsrecht</i>) was issued by
the prince. His legislative action was not always
hampered by any assembly of Estates; he desired
uniformity within his territory; and the jurists who
fashioned his law-book were free to romanize as
much as they pleased. The Würtemberg Landrecht
of 1555 issued by Duke Christopher, a prince
well known to Queen Elizabeth, is one of the chief
instances (Stintzing, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, pp. 537 ff.;
Schröder, <cite lang="de">Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte</cite>, ed. 3, pp.
886 ff.). The transmission of the cry for codification
from Hotman to Leibnitz, and then to the
enlightened monarchy of the eighteenth century is
traced by Baron, <cite>Franz Hotmans Antitribonian</cite>,
Bern, 1888. In Scotland also the Regent Morton
(d. 1581) entertained a project of codification. A
commission was appointed to prepare a uniform
and compendious order of the laws. It seems to
be a question among Scotch lawyers how far the
book known as <cite>Balfour’s Practicks</cite> represents the
work of the commissioners. See <cite>Dict. Nat. Biog.</cite>,

<div class="sidenote">The expiration of the Year Books.</div>

<p id="note49"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor49">[49]</a></span> The cessation of the Year Books in 1535 at
the moment when the Henrician Terror is at its
height is dramatically appropriate. A great deal,
however, has yet to be done before the relevant
facts will be fully known. Mr C. C. Soule’s
<cite>Year-Book Bibliography</cite>, printed in <cite>Harvard Law
Review</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">XIV.</span>, p. 557, is of high importance.
If by ‘the Year Books’ we mean a series of books
that have been printed, then the Year Books become
intermittent some time before they cease.
The first eleven years of Henry VIII are unrepresented,
and there are gaps between years 14
and 18 and between 19 and 26. It remains to be
seen whether there are MSS. more complete than
the printed series. Then we have on our hands
the question raised by what Plowden says in the
Preface to his <cite>Commentaries</cite> touching the existence
of official reporters. Plowden says that he began
to study the law in 30 Hen. VIII, and that he had
heard say that in ancient times there were four
reporters paid by the king. His words make it
clear that the official reporters, if they ever existed,
came to an end some considerable time before
30 Hen. VIII. The question whether they ever
existed cannot be raised here. Mr Pike’s investigations
have not, so I think, tended to bear out the
tale that Plowden had heard; and if the king paid
stipends to the reporters, some proof of this should
be forthcoming among the financial records. The
evidence of Francis Bacon is of later date and
looks like a mere repetition of what Plowden said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
(Bacon, <cite>Amendment of the Law</cite>; Spedding, <cite>Life

<div class="sidenote">Decline of law reports.</div>

<p>But, be all this as it may, the fact seems clear
that the ancient practice of law reporting passed
through a grave crisis in the sixteenth century.
We know the reign of Edward IV and even that
of Edward II better than we know that of
Edward VI. The zeal with which Tottell from
1553 onwards was printing old reports makes the
dearth of modern reports the more apparent. Then
Plowden expressly says that he reported ‘for my
private instruction only,’ and Dyer’s Reports (which
comprise some cases too early to have been reported
by him) were posthumously published. The
total mass of matter from the first half of the
century that we obtain under the names of Broke,
Benloe, Dalison, Keilwey, Moore and Anderson is
by no means large, and in many cases its quality
will not bear comparison with that of the Year
Books of Edward IV. (J. W. Wallace, <cite>The Reporters</cite>,
ed. 4, Boston, 1882, is an invaluable guide;

<p>This petition led to the disgrace and punishment
of the chancellor, the Earl of Southampton
(Wriothesley), for having issued a commission
without warrant and without consulting his fellow-executors
of King Henry’s will. With Somerset’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
motives for thrusting Southampton aside we are
not concerned. (See Pollard, <cite>England under the
Protector Somerset</cite>, pp. 31-33.) That he had any
desire to protect the common lawyers we must not
assume; but the petition itself deserves attention.
The commissioners to whom Southampton had
delegated judicial powers were Robert Southwell
(master of the rolls), John Tregonwell, John Oliver,
and Anthony Bellasyse (masters of chancery).
Tregonwell, Oliver and Bellasyse were all doctors
of the civil law (<cite>Dict. Nat. Biog.</cite>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common law and the Pilgrimage of Grace.</div>

<p>In 1536 during the Pilgrimage of Grace one of
the demands of the catholic insurgents was ‘that
the common laws may have place as was used at
the beginning of the reign and that no injunctions
be granted unless the matter has been determined
in chancery.’ This comes at the end of a long
reactionary programme, which desires the restoration
of the monasteries, of the papal supremacy
and so forth: also the repeal of the statute ‘That
no man shall not will his lands’ [Statute of Uses].
The heretical bishops [Cranmer and his like] are
to be burnt; Cromwell is ‘to have condign punishment.’
Also ‘a man is to be saved by his book,’
<i>i.e.</i> there is to be no infringement of the benefit of
clergy. The heresies to be suppressed are those of
‘Luther, Wyclif, Husse, Malangton, Elicampadus
[Oecolampadius], Bucerus, Confessa Germaniae
[Augsburg Confession], Apolugia Malanctons, the
works of Tyndall, of Barnys, of Marshall, Raskell
[Rastell, the printer of law books], Seynt Germayne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
[author of Doctor and Student] and such other
heresies of Anibaptist.’ As I understand the
protest against injunctions, it means that the
chancery may interfere with an action at common
law, only if that action is opening a question
already decided in the chancery. It will be seen
that in 1536 the cause of ‘the common laws’ finds
itself in very queer company: illiterate, monkish
and papistical company, which apparently has
made a man of ‘Anibaptist.’ (For this important
manifesto, see <cite>Letters and Papers, Henry VIII.</cite>,
vol. <span class="smcapuc">XI.</span>, pp. 506-507.)</p>

(1557) in Michaelmas terme men might have seene
in Westminster hall at the Kinges bench barre not
two men of law before the iustices; there was but
one named Fostar, who looked about and had

moe sergeants but one, which was sergeant Bouloise
[Bendlowes?], who looked about him, there was
elbow roome enough, which made the lawyers
complaine of their iniuries in that terme.’ In 1536
John Rastell the lawyer and printer of law books
complains to Cromwell that in both capacities he is
in a bad way: he used to print from two to three
hundred reams every year but now prints not a
hundred reams in two years; he used to make

by the Reception of Roman law, see Egelhaaf,

vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, pp. 544 ff.; Lamprecht, <cite lang="de">Deutsche Geschichte</cite>,

said that Roman jurisprudence ‘<span lang="de">auch wenn sie
nicht geradezu bauernfeindlich war, doch kein
Verständnis besass für die Mannigfaltigkeit der
bäuerlichen Besitzformen des deutschen Rechtes.</span>’
One of the revolutionary programmes proposed an
exclusion of all doctors of civil or canon law from
the courts and councils of the princes. See
Egelhaaf, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, pp. 499, 598. The following is a
pretty little tale:&mdash;‘<span lang="de">So geschah es wirklich einmal
zu Frauenfeld im Thurgau, wo die Schöffen einen
Doctor aus Constanz, der sich für die Entscheidung
eines Erbschaftsstreites auf Bartolus und Baldus
berufen wollte, zur Thüre hinauswarfen mit den
Worten: “Hört ihr, Doctor, wir Eidgenossen
fragen nicht nach dem Bartele und Baldele. Wir
haben sonderbare Landbräuche und Rechte. Naus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
mit euch, Doctor, naus mit euch!” Und habe,
heisst es in dem Berichte weiter, der gute Doctor
müssen abtreten, und sie Amtleute haben sich
einer Urtel verglichen, den Doctor wieder eingefordert
und ein Urtel geben wider den Bartele
und Baldele und wider den Doctor von Constanz.</span>’
(Janssen, <cite lang="de">Geschichte des deutschen Volkes</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>,
p. 490.) It is a serious question what would have
become of our English copyholders if in the
sixteenth century Roman law had been received.
The practical jurisprudence of this age seems to
have been kinder to the French than to the German
peasant; perhaps because it was less Roman in
France than in Germany. See E. Levasseur in
Lavisse et Rambaud, <cite lang="fr">Histoire générale</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>,
p. 188: ‘<span lang="fr">Des jurisconsultes commencèrent à considérer
l’inféodation comme une aliénation et le
colon censitaire comme le véritable propriétaire de
la terre sur laquelle le seigneur n’aurait possédé
qu’un droit <em>éminent</em>.</span>’ The true Romanist, I take
it, can know but one <i lang="la">dominium</i>, and is likely to give
that one to the lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">England and Germany.</div>

<p id="note55"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor55">[55]</a></span> As regards Germany, the theoretical continuance
of the Roman empire is not to be forgotten, but its
influence on the practical Reception of Roman law
may be overrated. In the age of the Reception
Roman law came to the aid, not of imperialism, but
of particularism. Then it is true that English law
was inoculated in the thirteenth century when
Bracton copied from Azo of Bologna. The effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of this is well stated by Dr Brunner in the inaugural
address delivered by him as rector of the University
of Berlin (<cite lang="de">Der Antheil des deutschen Rechtes an der
Entwicklung der Universitäten</cite>, Berlin, 1896, p. 15):
‘<span lang="de">In England und Frankreich, wo die Aufnahme
römischer Rechtsgedanken früher erfolgte, hat
diese nach Art einer prophylactischen Impfung
gewirkt und das mit ihnen gesättigte nationale
Recht widerstandsfähig gemacht gegen zerstörende
Infectionen.</span>’ As to the Roman law in Bracton,
I may be allowed to refer to <cite>Bracton and Azo</cite>,
Selden Society, 1895: in the introduction to that
volume I have ventured to controvert some sentences
that were written by Sir H. Maine. Bracton
became important for a second time in the sixteenth
century when (1569) his book was printed, for
it helped Coke to arrange his ideas, as any one may
see who looks at the margin of Coke’s books. The
medieval chancery has often been accused of
romanizing. Its procedure was suggested by a
summary procedure that had been devised by
decretists and legists: the general aim of that
scheme was the utmost simplicity and rapidity.
(Contrast this summary procedure as revealed by
<cite>Select Cases in Chancery</cite>, ed. Baildon, and <cite>Select
Cases in the Court of Requests</cite>, ed. Leadam, with
the solemn procedure of the civil law exemplified
by <cite>Select Cases in the Court of Admiralty</cite>, ed.
Marsden: these three books are published by the
Selden Society.) On the other hand, no proof has
been given that in the middle age the chancery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
introduced any substantive law of Roman origin.
At a later time when it began to steal work (suits
for legacies and the like) from the ecclesiastical
courts, it naturally borrowed the rules by which
those matters had theretofore been governed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reception in Scotland.</div>

<p>A full history of the Reception in Scotland
seems to be a desideratum. But see Goudy, <cite>Fate
of Roman Law</cite> (Inaugural Lecture), 1894; also
J. M. Irvine, <cite>Roman Law</cite> in <cite>Green’s Encyclopædia
of the Law of Scotland</cite>. Whether at any time
the Reception in Scotland ran the length that it
ran in Germany may be doubted; but the influence
exercised by English example since 1603 would
deserve the historian’s consideration. Even if this
influence went no further than the establishment
of the habit of finding ‘authority’ in decided cases,
it would be of great importance. Where such a
habit is established in practice and sanctioned by
theory, any return to the pure text, such as that
which was preached in Germany by ‘the historical
school,’ would be impossible. Also it may be
suggested that the Roman law which played
upon the law of Scotland in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries was not always very Roman,
but was strongly dashed with ‘Natural Law.’ For
instance, if in Scotland the firm of partners is a
‘legal person,’ this is not due to the influence of
Roman law as it is now understood by famous
expositors, or as it was understood in the middle
ages. Also (to take another example) it seems
impossible to get the Scotch ‘trust’ out of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
law by any fair process. The suggestion that it is
‘a contract made up of the two nominate contracts
of deposit and mandate’ seems a desperate effort
to romanize what is not Roman.</p>

In foreign countries there were gilds or fraternities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of lawyers. Thus in Paris the <i lang="fr">avocats</i> and <i lang="fr">procureurs</i>
about the middle of the fourteenth century
formed a fraternity of St Nicholas: ‘<span lang="fr">dont le chef
porte le bâton ou bannière (de là le nom de bâtonnier)</span>’:
Brissaud, <cite lang="fr">Histoire du droit français</cite>, p. 898.
But, though a certain care for the education of
apprentices was a natural function of the medieval
craft-gild, I cannot find that elsewhere than in
England fraternities of legal practitioners took upon
themselves to educate students and to give what in
effect were degrees, and degrees which admitted to
practice in the courts. R. Delachenal, <cite lang="fr">Histoire des
avocats au parlement de Paris</cite> (Paris, 1885), says
that, though not proved, it is probable that already
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the <i lang="fr">avocat</i>
had to be either <i lang="fr">licencié en lois</i> or <i lang="fr">licencié en décret</i>:
in other words, a legal degree given by an university
was necessary for the intending practitioner. As
regards the England of the same age two interesting
questions might be asked. Was there any considerable
number of doctors or bachelors of law
who were not clergymen? Had the English judge
or the English barrister usually been at an university?
I am inclined to think that a negative answer
should be given to the first question and perhaps
to the second also. Apparently Littleton (to take
one example) is not claimed by Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

<p>In 1550 an English lawyer’s library of printed
books might apparently have comprised (besides
some Statutes and Year Books) Littleton’s Tenures,
The Old Tenures, Statham’s Abridgement, Fitzherbert’s
Abridgement, Liber Intrationum, The Old
Natura Brevium, perhaps a Registrum Brevium (if
that book, printed in 1531, was published before
1553), Institutions or principal grounds etc. [1544],

Justice of the Peace, Perkins’s Profitable

of what was put into print was of medieval origin
and had been current in manuscript. In 1600 the
following might have been added: Glanvill, Bracton,
Fitzherbert’s Natura Brevium, Broke’s Abridgement,
Broke’s New Cases, Rastell’s Entries, Staundford’s
Prerogative and Pleas of the Crown, Crompton’s

to the Study of the Law [1600], Plowden’s
Commentaries, Dyer’s Reports and the first volume
of Coke’s Reports [1600]. This represents a
great advance. Already Fulbecke in his curious
book (which was reprinted as still useful in 1829)
attempts a review of English legal literature:
a critical estimate of Dyer, Plowden, Staundford,
Perkins and other writers. Lambard’s revelation of
the Anglo-Saxon laws was not unimportant, for a
basis was thus laid for national boasts; and, but for
the publication of Glanvill, Bracton and Britton,
the work that was done by Coke would have been
impossible.</p>

p. 170: ‘“I retired to a country village,” Chancellor
Kent tells us in speaking of the breaking up of Yale
College by the war, where he was a student in 1779,
“and, finding Blackstone’s Commentaries, I read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
four volumes.… The work inspired me at the age of
fifteen with awe, and I fondly determined to be a
lawyer.” … “There is abundant evidence,” if we may
rely upon the authority of Dr Hammond, whose
language I quote, “of the immediate absorption of
nearly twenty-five hundred copies of the Commentaries

of Independence.”’</p>

<p id="note72"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor72">[72]</a></span> Thayer, <cite>John Marshall</cite>, 1901, p. 6: ‘When
Marshall was about eighteen years old he began
to study Blackstone.… He seems to have found a
copy of Blackstone in his father’s house.… Just now
the first American edition was out (Philadelphia,
1771-2), in which the list of subscribers, headed
by the name of “John Adams, barrister at law,
Boston,” had also that of “Captain Thomas
Marshall, Clerk of Dunmore County.”’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman law in America.</div>

<p id="note73"><span class="label"><a href="#anchor73">[73]</a></span> It may be interesting to notice that in 1856,
and perhaps even in 1871, Sir H. Maine believed
that the Code of Louisiana (‘of all republications
of Roman law the one which appears to us the
clearest, the fullest, the most philosophical and the
best adapted to the exigencies of modern society’)
had a grand destiny before it in the United States.
‘Now it is this code, and not the Common Law of
England which the newest American States are
taking for the substratum of their laws.… The
Roman law is, therefore, fast becoming the lingua
franca of universal jurisprudence.’ (Maine, <cite>Roman
Law and Legal Education</cite>, 1856, reprinted in <cite>Village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Communities</cite>, ed. 3, pp. 360-1.) Nowadays this hope
or fear of a Reception of Roman law in the United
States seems, so I am given to understand, quite
unfounded. See e.g. J. F. Dillon, <cite>Laws and Jurisprudence
of England and America</cite>, 1894, p. 155:
‘the common law [in distinction from the Roman
or civil law] is the basis of the laws of every State
and Territory of the Union, with comparatively
unimportant and gradually waning exceptions.’</p>

Old Series, vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, p. 191. Despite the careful
exclusion of almost all words derived from the Latin
(except <i>Hypothek</i>, which happens to be Greek), the
new law book may look Roman to an Englishman;
but then it does not look Roman to Germans. The
following sentences are taken from a speech delivered
in the Reichstag (Mugdan, <cite lang="de">Materialien zum
bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch</cite>, vol. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>, pp. 876-7): ‘<span lang="de">In
dieser Beziehung ist vor Allem der Vorwurf gegen
den Entwurf erhoben, er enthalte materiell kein
deutsches Recht.… Selten ist ein Vorwurf unbegründeter
gewesen.… Das Sachenrecht ist von A
bis Z durchaus deutsches Recht.… Was dann den
Begriff des Besitzes betrifft, von der ganzen römischen
Besitztheorie ist nichts übrig geblieben.…
Der allgemeine Theil des Obligationenrechtes ist
natürlich römischen Ursprunges.… Kommen wir
aber zu den einzelnen speziellen Rechtsgeschäften,
so treffen wir auch da sofort wieder deutsches
Recht.… Auch das Familienrecht ist durchaus
deutschrechtlich.… Dann ist das Erbrecht durch

supposition that codification means romanization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is baseless; it may mean deromanization. But the
great lesson to be learnt by Englishmen from the
German Code is that a democratically elected
assembly, which is for many purposes divided into
bitterly contending fractions, can be induced to
show a wonderful forbearance when uniformity of
law is to be attained.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
